Matasano Cryptopals Solutions
=============================

The first set solutions: ```simplecrypt.py```

I also use ```nosetests``` to test if my solutions are right (if it can 
be easily automated). 

The first set tests: ```tests/simplecrypt_tests.py```

You can run these tests from the matasano directory by typing:

```
nosetests -v
```
